Key oceanographic transects are the Newport Line off Oregon, the Trinidad Head Line off northern California, and CalCOFI lines further south, while shaded marine regions indicate sampling areas for most biological surveys. This sampling is complemented by basin-scale oceanographic observations and by outputs from various models. Figure 1 also shows sampling areas for most biological indicators. The shaded terrestrial areas in Figure 1 represent freshwater ecoregions in the CCE, and are the basis by which we summarize indicators for snowpack, flows, and stream temperatures.\nFigure 1: Map of most sampling efforts in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) and U.S. west coast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Symbols indicate hydrographic line sampling stations for oceanographic data. Shaded ocean regions represent biological sampling areas for the Northern California Current (NCC), which includes the Juvenile Salmon and Ocean Ecology Survey (JSOES); the Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (RREAS), including its Core Area; and the CalCOFI sampling region. The NCC and RREAS shaded areas, combined, also approximate the survey footprints for NOAA’s coastwide CPS acoustic/trawl and groundfish bottom trawl surveys. Dashed line approximates foraging area for adult female California sea lions from the San Miguel colony. Shaded terrestrial areas represent the six freshwater ecoregions in the CCE.\nThe list below shows which versions of all related products correspond to a specific Ecosystem Status report cycle.

    "text": "About The Technical Documentation for the Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) is a Quarto document; hosted on the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) Github page, and developed in R. Derived data used to populate figures in this document are queried directly from the xxxxx R package or the SWFSC ERDDAP server. ERDDAP queries are made using the R package rerddap.\nAccessing data and build code In this technical documentation, we hope to shine a light on the processing and analytical steps involved to get from source data to final product. This means that whenever possible, we have included the code involved in source data extraction, processing, and analyses. We have also attempted to thoroughly describe all methods in place of or in supplement to provided code. Example plotting code for each indicator is presented in sections titled “Plotting”, and these code chunks can be used to recreate the figures found in ecosystem reporting documents where each respective indicator was included1.\nSource data for the derived indicators in this document are linked to in the text unless there are privacy concerns involved. In that case, it may be possible to access source data by reaching out to the Point of Contact associated with that data set. Derived data sets make up the majority of the indicators presented in ecosystem reporting documents, and these data sets are available for download through the ecodata R package.\nBuilding the document Start a local build of the ESR Quarto document by first cloning the project’s associated git repository. Next, if you would like to build a past version of the document, use git checkout [version_commit_hash] to revert the project to a past commit of interest, and set build_latest &lt;- FALSE in this code chunk. This will ensure the project builds from a cached data set, and not the most updated versions present on the NEFSC ERDDAP server. Once the xxxxx.Rproj file is opened in RStudio, run Quarto::serve_book() from the console to build the document.\nA note on data structures The majority of the derived time series used in Ecosystem Status reports are in long format. This approach was taken so that all disparate data sets could be “bound” together for ease of use in our base plotting functions.\ncatalog link",

Prior to 2018, time series indicators in State of the Ecosystem reports were presented with trend lines based on a Mann-Kendall test for monotonic trends to test significance (p &lt; 0.05) of both long term (full time series) and recent (2007–2016) trends, although not all time series were considered for trend analysis due to limited series lengths. There was also concern that a Mann-Kendall test would not account for any autocorrelation present in State of the Ecosystem (SOE) indicators.\nThe best fit model was tested against the null hypothesis of no trend through a likelihood ratio test (p &lt; 0.05). All models were fit using the R package nlme (Pinheiro et al. 2017) and AICc was calculated using the R package AICcmodavg (Mazerolle 2017).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Methods Conceptual models were constructed to facilitate multidisciplinary analysis and discussion of the linked social-ecological system for integrated ecosystem assessment. The overall process was to first identify the components of the model (focal groups, human activities, environmental drivers, and objectives), and then to document criteria for including groups and linkages and what the specific links were between the components.\nThe prototype conceptual model used to design Northeast US conceptual models for each ecosystem production unit (EPU) was designed by the California Current IEA program. The California Current IEA developed an overview conceptual model for the Northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (NCC), with models for each focal ecosystem component that detailed the ecological, environmental, and human system linkages. Another set of conceptual models outlined habitat linkages.\nAn inital conceptual model…..\nData Source(s) Habitat-fishery linkages were drawn from unpublished reports, including:\nData Extraction “Data” included model estimated quantities to determine whether inclusion thresholds were met for each potential link in the conceptual model. A matrix with diet composition for each modeled group is an input to the food web model. A matrix of mortalities caused by each predator and fishery on each modeled group is a direct ouput of a food web model (e.g. Ecopath). Food web model biomasss flows between species, fisheries, and detritus were summarized using algorithms implemented in visual basic by Kerim Aydin, NOAA NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center. Because EMAX model groups were aggregated across species, selected diet compositions for individual species were taken from the NEFSC food habits database using the FEAST program for selected species (example query below). These diet queries were consulted as supplemental information.\nData Analysis Aggregated diet and mortality information was examined to determine the type of link, direction of link, and which links between which groups should be inclded in the conceptual models. Two types of ecological links were defined using food web models: prey links and predation/fishing mortality links. Prey links resulted in positve links between the prey group and the focal group, while predation/fishing mortality links resulted in negative links to the focal group to represent energy flows. The intent was to include only the most important linkages between focal groups and with other groups supporting or causing mortality on focal species groups. Therefore, threshold levels of diet and mortality were established (based on those that would select the top 1-3 prey and predators of each focal group): 10% to include a link (or add a linked group) in the model and 20% to include as a strong link. A Primary Production group was included in each model and linked to pelagic habitat to allow environmental effects on habitat to be connected to the ecologial submodel. Uncertainty for the inclusion of each link and for the magnitude of each link was qualitatively assessed and noted in the spreadsheet.\ncatalog link No associated catalog page",

The NPGO is the second dominant mode.\n\n\nDescription ENSO events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity.\nThe PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME.\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity.\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are from N. Mantua, NMFS/SWFSC, and are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html).

MHWs are a growing field of study worldwide because of their effects on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and regional economies. Developed by oceanographers from NOAA Fisheries’ Southwest Fisheries Science Center as an experimental tool for natural resource managers, the California Current MHW Tracker is a program designed to understand, describe, and provide a historical context for the 2014-16 blob. It also produces a range of indices that could help forecast or predict future MHWs expected to impact our coast.\n\n\nDescription Marine heatwaves (MHW) occur when ocean temperatures are much warmer than usual for an extended period of time; they are specifically defined by the difference between the current temperature and the expected temperature for a specific location and time of year [1]. MHWs are a growing field of study worldwide because of their effects on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and regional economies.\nAdditional Information\nThere is growing recognition that marine heatwaves can have strongly disruptive impacts on the CCE (Morgan et al. 2019). Based on an analysis of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) obtained from satellite measurements (OISST); we define marine heatwaves as 1.0 times when normalized SSTa &gt;1.29 s.d. (90th percentile) of the long-term SSTa time series at a location, and 2. lasts for &gt;5 days; which are analogous to the thresholds suggested in Hobday et al. (2016). Here, we further report on statistics concerning large heatwaves (LHW) which were tracked through space and time, with LHW defined as those heatwaves with an area &gt; 400,000 km2 (these denote the top 20% of all heatwaves by area as measured since 1982 when satellite data became available for tracking.\nThe underlying climatology used for SST anomaly analysis has changed from 1982-2010, to now encompass 1982-2020; hence small changes in the retrospective analysis of tracked heatwaves reported more recently as compared to previous reports.\nFigures\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nHobday, Alistair J, Lisa V Alexander, Sarah E Perkins, Dan A Smale, Sandra C Straub, Eric CJ Oliver, Jessica A Benthuysen, et al. 2016. “A hierarchical approach to defining marine heatwaves.” Progress in Oceanography 141: 227–38.\n\n\nMorgan, Cheryl A, Brian R Beckman, Laurie A Weitkamp, and Kurt L Fresh. 2019. “Recent ecosystem disturbance in the Northern California current.” Fisheries 44 (10): 465–74.",

Time series of the upwelling indices CUTI and BUTI provide information on upwelling strength at sub-seasonal frequency and upwelling phenology, and allow interannual comparisons of seasonal upwelling timing and frequency. Additionally, the calculation of cumulative upwelling allows for a comparison of the total amount of upwelling a region receives during the entire course of the year. Cumulative upwelling is calculated as the daily summation of upwelling values (additive for positive upwelling, and subtractive for negative upwelling - aka downwelling) starting on Jan 1 and ending on Dec 31st.\nData extraction\nData analysis\ncatalog link",

DO is required for organismal respiration; low DO can compress habitat and cause stress or die-offs for sensitive species. Waters with DO levels &lt;1.4 mL/L (~ 2 mg/L, note unit change) are considered to be hypoxic; such conditions may occur on the shelf following the onset of spring upwelling, and continue into the summer and early fall months until the fall transition vertically mixes shelf waters. Upwelling-driven hypoxia occurs because upwelled water from deeper ocean sources tends to be low in DO, and microbial decomposition of organic matter in the summer and fall increases overall system respiration and oxygen consumption, particularly closer to the seafloor (Chan et al. (2008)).\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis\n\n\n\n\nChan, Francis, JA Barth, J Lubchenco, A Kirincich, H Weeks, William T Peterson, and BA Menge. 2008. “Emergence of anoxia in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem.” Science 319 (5865): 920–20.",

Upwelling transports hypoxic, acidified waters from deeper offshore onto the continental shelf, where increased community-level metabolic activity can further exacerbate OA (Feely et al. (2008)). A key indicator of OA is aragonite saturation state, a measure of the availability of aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate). Aragonite saturation &lt;1.0 indicates relatively acidified, corrosive conditions that are stressful for many CCE species, particularly shell-forming invertebrates. OA impacts on these species can propagate through marine food webs and potentially affect fisheries (Marshall et al. 2017). Aragonite saturation states tend to be lowest during spring and summer upwelling, and highest in winter.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis\n\n\n\n\nFeely, Richard A, Christopher L Sabine, J Martin Hernandez-Ayon, Debby Ianson, and Burke Hales. 2008. “Evidence for upwelling of corrosive\" acidified\" water onto the continental shelf.” Science 320 (5882): 1490–92.",

The framework facilitates comparisons of data at the right spatial scale for particular users, whether this be the entire California Current, ecoregions within the CCE, or smaller spatial units. The framework we use divides the region encompassed by the CCE into ecoregions (Fig. 1.1), and ecoregions into smaller physiographic units. Freshwater ecoregions are based on the biogeographic delineations in Abell et al. (2008), see also www.feow.org, who define six ecoregions for watersheds entering the California Current, three of which comprise the two largest watersheds directly entering the California Current (the Columbia and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers). Within ecoregions, we summarized data at scales of evolutionary significant units (ESUs) and 8-field hydrologic unit classifications (HUC-8).

Note that commercial catches are limited to males that are roughly 4 years old, so landings can also be interpreted as the 4-year-old year class of the population. There was also a noted difference in the relationship between heatwave and non-heatwave years. Within this time series, there were three years (2015, 2016, and 2019) when marine heat waves occurred over the continental shelf off Oregon. These results suggest that the size of the Dungeness crab population is strongly influenced by the annual larval success, as indicated by the number of megalopae caught; and in years with marine heat waves, recruitment from megalopae to 4-year-old crabs is higher. While only Oregon data are shown, the light trap data is positively correlated with commercial catch in California, but is not correlated with catches in Washington. This index stems from a collaborative effort between the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB, University of Oregon) and ODFW and warrants further attention in the future as an additional index of prey availability in this region.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

The surveys cover waters to at least the 1,000-fathom (1829-m) isobath, or 65 km from shore. The five most abundant CPS in this domain are Northern Anchovy, Pacific Herring, Pacific Sardine, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Mackerel. The biomass of Pacific Sardine is calculated separately for the northern and southern stocks based on oceanographic habitat, spatial separation, and demographic structure (Zwolinski and Demer 2023). The ATM combines data from echosounders, which record CPS echoes, and trawls, which produce information about the composition, sizes, and ages of the fishes. This survey also samples the densities of CPS eggs at 3-m depth using a continuous underway fish egg sampler (CUFES) mounted on the ship’s hull.\nCPS surveys typically span the area between Cape Flattery and San Diego, but in some years also include Vancouver Island, Canada (2015-2019) and portions of Baja CA (2021-2022).

    "text": "Description We use color to represent anomalous years for the stoplight tables presented in the salmon section of the report. As described in Harvey et al. (2023), we have addressed past feedback from the SSC and others by developing a more statistically based stoplight table format, which produces five bins that are determined relative to a fixed baseline reference period. In this new format, we assumed a normal distribution for each of the indicators and estimated a mean and standard deviation for the base period. For each cell within a given indicator, we determined how many standard deviations the values were from their respective base period mean and used a five-color set to indicate whether a value was &gt;2 s.d. below the mean, 1 to 2 s.d. below the mean, within 1 s.d. of the mean in either direction, 1 to 2 s.d. above the mean, or &gt;2 s.d. above the mean. This approach overcomes many of the issues that had been previously identified (e.g., better highlighting values that represent truly exceptional years; past values are now static and do not suddenly change colors; etc.).\n[this section will require a bit more writingto incorporate evolving approaches and methods]\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

Separate models have been developed for spring and fall Chinook salmon and steelhead from the Snake River basins and spring Chinook salmon from the Upper Columbia basin. The specific approach uses a Dynamic Linear Model, founded on linear regressions of single ecosystem indicators vs. survival rates of PIT-tagged fish that left Bonneville Dam as smolts and returned as adults. The model labeled “Stoplight PC1” uses the first principal component (PC1) from a Principal Component Analysis of the stoplight chart as a covariate. The second model, labeled “CMISST” uses a Covariance Map Index of Sea Surface Temperature (B. Burke, unpublished), which is a metric derived by calculating the similarity of sea surface temperature (SST) spatial patterns in the North Pacific Ocean to a stock-specific optimal pattern. The CMISST metric is still in development, but analyzes to date indicate that the CMISST model has better prediction skill for spring Chinook salmon and steelhead SAR, while the PC1 model has better prediction skill for fall Chinook salmon SAR.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis\ncatalog link",

    "text": "Description. Central Valley Fall Chinook salmon stoplight table: In the 2019-2020 ecosystem status report (REFERENCE), we introduced a relatively simple “stoplight” table of ecosystem indicators that were shown by Friedman et al. (2019) to be correlated with returns of naturally produced Central Valley Fall Chinook salmon. In an updated stoplight chart for adult Fall Chinook salmon returning to the Central Valley in 2024, the focal ecosystem indicators are: spawning escapement of parent generations; egg incubation temperature between October and December at Red Bluff Diversion Dam (Sacramento River); egg thiamine concentrations based on averages of samples collected from Central Valley fall run hatchery programs; median flow in the Sacramento River in the February after fry emergence; and a marine predation index based on the abundance of common murres at Southeast Farallon Island and the proportion of juvenile salmon in their diets. Reflecting discussions with the SSC-ES in September 2020, we emphasize that this stoplight chart is strictly qualitative and contextual decision-support information. Qualitative descriptors (color-coded terms like “very poor”) are based on recent time series and on expert opinion of how a given indicator relates to quantitative analysis of the relationship between the indicator and life-stage specific survival (see Figure 5 in Friedman et al. 2019). For example, in the stoplight Table flows rated “very low” (&lt;7,000 cfs) are consistent with &lt;25% rearing/outmigration survival rates, while the flows rated “low” (7,000 to 20,000 cfs) were consistent with 25-50% outmigrant survival (see Fig. 5 in, Friedman et al. 2019). Egg incubation temperatures in the Table were consistent with egg-to-fry survival ranging from ~50% (which we rated as “suboptimal”) to 0% at &gt; 13 C (“very poor/cohort failure”). We continue to refine these qualitative categories for future reports so that their basis is more explicit.\nThe escapement descriptor is a qualitative evaluation of how natural-area escapement of a parent generation relates to the natural area + hatchery escapement goal of 122,000– 180,000 fish, with 122,000 spawners as the SMSY target (PFMC 2022d). Natural area escapement is relevant to the stoplight table as an indicator of total natural area egg production (e.g., Munsch et al. 2020). However, the qualification of this indicator requires future research. Obviously, using a natural+hatchery target as the qualifier for natural-only escapement is problematic. Perhaps more importantly, the SSC and STT have both recommended research and reconsideration of the Sacramento River fall Chinook SMSY objective (PFMC 2022e,f), and Satterthwaite (2022) has concluded that an escapement of 122,000 adults is insufficient to maximize natural production. We have not been able to fully address the SSC and SST comments yet.\nThe qualitative nature of this stoplight table is in part due to the fact that some of the parameters used by Friedman et al. (2019) were estimated using information from both natural-origin and hatchery-origin fish, and while it is reasonable to assume that true parameter values would be similar, given correlations between natural and hatchery escapements, additional data specific to natural-origin fish are likely necessary in order to improve model fits, evaluate other potential covariates, and support adequate testing of model predictive skill.\n[include here Table J.1 which documents the habitat indicators, definitions, and key references]\nMethods. The indicators in Table J.1 have been shown in previous studies or were proposed in rebuilding plans to be strongly related with life-stage specific Chinook salmon productivity, and these studies helped determine expected directionality of indicators with stock productivity (see below and Harvey et al. 2020 for additional justification). Four of the five broad categories of indicators in the stoplight charts align with the simpler stoplight chart for Central Valley fall Chinook salmon presented in the main body of this report (Table 3.2): Adult Spawners, Incubation conditions, Freshwater / Estuarine Residence conditions, and Marine Residence conditions (for the first year of marine residence). The fifth category of indicators, Hatchery Releases, expands the scope of these tables relative Table 3.2, which focuses only on natural-area fish. The habitat indicator charts also share qualities with the stoplight chart developed for Columbia Basin Chinook salmon and Oregon coast coho salmon (Table 3.1) by including regional and basin-scale oceanographic indicators as part of early marine residence conditions. Data on krill off northern California are also presented within the table for KRFC.\nThe indicators in Table J.1 and in the stoplight tables above have undergone several important adjustments from previous reports:\nUpdates to SRFC and KRFC include changes in some indicators to ensure more reliable and timely data capture. However, updates of many indicators in 2023 remain challenging due to delays in posting of online datasets, resulting in several indicators that could not be updated for this year’s report and preliminary estimates for several others. These challenges underscore the importance of including multiple indicators, highlight the potential fragility of these annual summaries, and point to the importance of many individuals for maintaining the databases required for summarizing habitat indicators.\nRecent analysis of krill off northern California have revealed that krill length is a much better indicator than krill biomass for predicting productivity of Klamath Fall run (see Section 3.1), so we have substituted length for this indicator.\nCVSC differs from SRFC not only in migration timing but also in their behavior and spatial distribution. Habitat indicators reflect these differences, by characterizing early upstream migration starting in February, holding in pools through the summer, and spawning in a small number of creeks in the late summer and fall. Adult numbers focused on spawner counts in Butte, Mill, and Deer Creeks. Butte Creek spawners migrate from the Sacramento River through Sutter Bypass to Butte Creek, and outmigrants may rear within Sutter Bypass during outmigration. Hence, flow and temperature metrics relied on gages from these systems in addition to the Sacramento mainstem, and Sutter Bypass inundation instead of Yolo Bypass. Finally, the sole hatchery for CVSC is from Feather River, so releases and timing metrics focused on data from just this hatchery.\nThe stoplight tables are categorized from favorable to poor conditions using the same approach as described for the Northern California Current salmon indicator stoplight table (see Appendix J.1). Specifically, after indicator datasets were collected, all indicators were “directionalized” to account for their expected relationships with stock productivity (based on the “Effect” column in (Table J.1) and converted into standardized values. These values are reported in the stoplight tables above, with colors delineating statistically meaningful departures (&gt;2 s.d.) toward poorer (warm shades) or more productive (cool shades) conditions compared to near-average years (within ±1 s.d., yellow). The main difference for the tables shown here relative to (Table 3.1) is that we have not yet determined a fixed historic reference period for the SRFC, KRFC and CVSC tables, due in part to missing data from one or more indicators in large portions of the time series.\nHabitat Indicator Descriptions. Adults returning and migrating to spawning grounds: Spawning adults set the cohort size (Friedman et al. 2019) and potential for density-dependent habitat limitations at future life stages (Munsch et al. 2020), so we incorporated estimated escapements from PFMC preseason forecasts. Adults must navigate multiple potential barriers to reach spawning grounds, including low river flows and high temperatures at the end of summer. We used flow and temperature measurements from the lower portions of the Sacramento and Klamath Rivers in September and October. In the Sacramento River, adults must also navigate the channel network of the delta, and the rebuilding plan proposed examining potential effects of the Delta Cross Channel as a migration barrier. We used the proportion of time the Cross Channel was closed in September and October as the indicator.\nIndicators for adult migrations differ for CVSC due to their early migration timing (February to May), spring-summer holding in pools, and spawning in a small number of Sacramento tributaries. We restricted the enumerated spawner abundance to Deer, Mill, and Butte Creeks, for which records were consistently maintained throughout the 1983-present period of record. To fill in data gaps of spawner counts for Butte Creek (the largest spawning population) to complete the retrospective time series to the 1983 brood year, we used predictions from regressions of Butte Creek spawner counts and snorkel surveys. Flows and temperatures during holding were restricted to the river with the greatest spawner abundance (Butte Creek). In addition, CDFW conducts estimates of pre-spawn mortality which we added as an indicator due to CVSC’s exposure to warm in-river conditions.\nIncubation to emergence: After spawning, incubating eggs may be subject to dewatering in the river (Jager et al. 1997) and are sensitive to high temperatures (Friedman et al. 2019). For SRFC, the river flow indicator was derived from the seven-day 10th percentile of flow for the Sacramento River from October to December at Bend Bridge near Red Bluff. For CVSC, we used similar flow conditions for Butte Creek. For KRFC, dewatering previously was observed in various tributaries of the Klamath. Hence, minimum flows from four gages (Klamath at Iron Gate, Scott River, Shasta River, and Trinity River at Lewiston Dam) were used, and the index was calculated from the average of standardized flow values. Incubation temperature records were obtained for all three river systems, albeit for a much shorter time series in the Klamath. SRFC incubation temperature estimates are from Red Bluff Diversion Dam (data in Friedman et al. 2019), CVSC records are from Butte Creek, and Klamath records are from Seiad Valley. Egg-fry productivity as measured by migrants per spawner were initiated in the early 2000s for all stocks.\nFreshwater and estuary residence: During migration to the ocean, fall Chinook salmon stocks take advantage of temporary residence in riverine and estuary habitats before transitioning to marine environments. We used a variety of indicators of habitat conditions during this stage. Freshwater conditions are set by precipitation and spring air temperatures, both of which influence snowpack salmon runs and river flow (Munsch et al. 2019) in both tributaries (important for CVSC in particular) and mainstem. In turn, flows from December to May (and their temporal variation) set conditions for rearing in river and estuary systems as fish move downstream, and have been linked to freshwater (Munsch et al. 2019) and life-cycle productivity (Michel 2019, Friedman et al. 2019). Higher flows also determine access to floodplain rearing in reaches such as the Yolo Bypass for SRFC (Limm and Marchetti 2009) and Sutter Bypass for CVSC, as well as the potential to flush polychaete hosts of the parasite Ceratomyxa shasta that infects juvenile salmon during outmigration (Jordan 2012). Flows also determine the outflow through the Sacramento delta (Reis et al. 2019), which can influence estuarine rearing opportunities (Munsch et al. 2020). To shift freshwater flows to pumping facilities, the Bureau of Reclamation opens the Delta Cross Channel, and this pathway can entrain salmon in pumps or otherwise expose them to higher mortality (Perry et al. 2013).\nMagnitude and timing of hatchery releases: While much of the habitat indicators focus on natural-area fish, hatchery releases make up a significant contribution of each run and may also contribute to density dependence. We therefore included the annual total of hatchery releases, using data from up to four SRFC hatcheries on the Sacramento (San Joaquin hatcheries were not included), the Feather River hatchery for CVSC, and Trinity and Iron Gate hatcheries in the Klamath. While hatchery-origin juveniles are also sensitive to the conditions natural-origin juveniles face, they are generally raised until they are primed for rapid migration. Following concepts of match-mismatch theory (Cushing 1990), we compared release date with the date of peak spring flow in freshwater and the spring transition in the ocean, as Satterthwaite et al. (2014) showed that both timing of release relative to the spring transition and overall later release timing were positively correlated with survival rates. Fates of hatchery fish may be a consequence of release location (Sturrock et al. 2019), including locations external to the Sacramento River system, so we also included the proportion of releases that were seaward of Sherman Island in the lower delta.\nMarine residence: Marine residence of 1 to 5 years completes the life cycle for fall run Chinook salmon populations. While a broad number of marine habitat indicators have been examined (Wells et al. 2008), we focused on a limited subset of possible indicators representing initial set-up of ocean entry conditions (March-May), including sea surface temperature, the North Pacific Index, and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. We also included an index of predation by common murres nesting at Southeast Farallon Island, which was a strong predictor in Friedman et al. (2019). Unfortunately, this indicator currently cannot be updated quantitatively. On the positive side, we have updated the krill prey indicator for Klamath River fall Chinook salmon from biomass to average length to better reflect stronger correlations with recruits per spawner. Where indicators were averaged to obtain a marine habitat conditions score, hatchery release timing relative to the spring transition was also included as a marine habitat condition.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis\ncatalog link",

    "text": "Description Yearly indices of the abundances of juvenile sablefish, Dover sole, shortspine thornyhead, and longspine thornyhead along the West Coast were calculated using species distribution models. Strong year classes can determine age structure and set stock size for marine fishes, and may also indicate favorable environmental conditions, increased future catches, and impending potential bycatch issues. Here, we provide estimates of juvenile abundance for 13 species of West Coast groundfishes, including four from DTS assemblage (Dover sole, thornyheads, and sablefish) as a potential leading indicator of incoming strong year classes. The DTS assemblage is a valuable fishery, and bycatch of some species, like small sablefish, can impact other fisheries such as the at-sea hake fishery.\nData sources Data for indicators come from the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS) (Keller et al. 2017) for 2003-2021. There were no data for 2020 because the WCGBTS was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey data includes estimates of age, length, and biomass for subsamples of each haul, and occasionally for the entire haul when catch is low.\nData extraction\nData were downloaded from the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring data Warehouse (https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/map)\nData analysis\nWe used species distribution models to calculate indices of abundance for juvenile groundfish. The approach follows the general approach of Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) but uses the ‘sdmTMB’ package (Anderson et al. 2022) for R instead of the ‘VAST’ package (Thorson 2019). VAST was was reviewed by the SSC-ES in September 2021. The sdmTMB approach is used by many West Coast groundfish stock assessment biologists to assimilate survey data and was reviewed favorably by the SSC-Groundfish Subcommittee in summer of 2022 (PFMC 2022c).\nThe analyses estimate the biomass for each species by using length-age and length-weight relationships to expand the trawl data. Length is measured (cm total length) for all individuals in the subsample, but many individual fishes lack weight or age data due to time constraints in the field and ageing lab. To expand the subsample,\n\nMissing weights for individuals in the subsample were obtained by first estimating the length-weight relationship from existing data and using this relationship to estimate the missing weights from known lengths. For Dover sole, sablefish and longspine thornyhead, male and female length-weight relationships were estimated separately and the average of these relationships used to determine weights for individuals where sex was not known. For shortspine thornyhead, we used a single length-weight relationship.\nIndividual fish were then allocated to age classes following Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) by using length-age relationships from the WCGBTS data to determine age-class maximum lengths. See Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) for more detail. The maximum lengths used here (Table 36.1) were taken from Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) (Table 36.1).\nThe proportional biomass of juveniles in each subsample was calculated and used to estimate the total biomass of juvenile fishes in the full trawl.\nTrawl biomass was then used in the following sdmTMB species distribution models.\n\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ purrr::compose() masks flextable::compose()\n✖ dplyr::filter()  masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()     masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\nTable 36.1: Length, age, and depth range information.\n\n\n\nCommon nameSpeciesMax length (cm)Age classDepth range (m)Arrowtooth flounderAtheresthes stomias22150-470Darkblotched rockfishSebastes crameri150-180-240Dover soleMicrostomus pacificus171-250-465English soleaParophrys vetulus16150-140LingcodOphiodon elongatus25050-240Longspine thornyheadSebastolobus altivelis7&lt;5385-1245Pacific grenadierCoryphaenoides acrolepis3~1490-1275Pacific hakeMerluccius productus150-150-700Pacific sanddabCitharichthys sordidus130-150-245Petrale soleEopsetta jordani211-250-200SablefishAnoplopoma fimbria29050-475Shortspine thornyheadSebastolobus alascanus8&lt;5160-625Splitnose rockfishSebastes diploproa100-165-460\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastwide juvenile groundfish abundances were estimated using a spatially explicit, species distribution model evaluated with the sdmTMB package in R. The response variable was CPUE quantified as kg of juveniles per km2. The models included one common intercept across years, and spatial and spatiotemporal random fields, with anisotropy to account for different rates of autocorrelation with latitude versus longitude (~ depth). The common intercept prevents the model from forcing biomass to increase or decrease coastwide in a given year (thereby potentially overestimating recruitment in some areas) as would be the case for yearly intercept. Normalized depth was included to account for differences in density across depths.\nTo avoid projecting to areas with zero biomass, the depth range of the data used for each species in the analysis was restricted based on the distribution of positive biomass observations (Table K.1). Again, the values used here follow Tolimieri et al. (2020) with the exception that the lower depth limit for sablefish was set to 250 m, which encompasses more than 99% of their observed juvenile biomass. Pass was included as a fixed factor (as a proxy for time of year; the WCGBTS conducts two coastwide passes each year, in May-July and August-October). Models were fit with a delta-gamma distribution to account for the prevalence of zeros in the data, and the mesh was set to 10 km, resulting in 650-800 knots depending upon species. Model fits were then extrapolated to a 2x2 km grid of the West Coast to estimate total abundance in kg for juveniles in a given year. For some species, it was necessary to combine age or size classes to obtain enough data for models to converge. The resulting biomass estimate was converted to an index scaled between 0-1 by dividing all values by the maximum upper 95% confidence limit in the time series.\nTo address previous suggestions by the SSC-ES, we also evaluated models with year included as a fixed factor or allowed year to have a random intercept. When included as a fixed factor, models failed to converge likely due to identifiability problems due to also including the spatiotemporal random field. For sablefish and Dover sole, inclusion of year with a random intercept also created fit problems leading to very large standard errors for some estimated parameters. Therefore, we excluded the term from the final models.\n2025-01 Update\nPreviously models for all species included a delta-poisson-link-gamma model/error structure and normalized depth as a linear variable. In 2025 models were updated to tailor model structure and the form of depth (linear, quadratic, smoothed) to individuals species. We fit models with Tweedie, delta-lognormal, delta-poisson-link-gamma, and delta-gamma model/errors. Depth was normalized and included as a linear variabe, as a quadratic, smoothed (GAM), or not included. The best model was chosen for each species based on a comparison of AIC values, QQ residual plots, and sanity (model fit) output (Table 36.2). This approach produced better residuals and tended to dampen some of the higher biomass estimates (see sablefish in the main report).\n\n\n\n\nTable 36.2: Model informaiton for juvenile abundance models used in the FY2025 report.\n\n\n\nSpeciesDistributionDepthArrowtooth flounderTweedieGAM smoothDarkblotch rockfishTweedieGAM smoothDover soledelta-gamma-poisson-linkquadraticEnglish soledelta-gammaquadraticLingcodTweediequadraticLongspine thornyheaddelta-lognormalGAM smoothPacific grenadierdelta-gammaGAM smoothPacific hakeTweedieGAM smoothPacific sandlanceTweediequadraticPetrale soledelta-lognormalquadraticSablefishdelta-lognormalquadraticShortspine thornyheadTweediequadraticSplitnose rockfishTweedieGAM smooth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson, Sean C, Eric J Ward, Philina A English, and Lewis AK Barnett. 2022. “sdmTMB: an R package for fast, flexible, and user-friendly generalized linear mixed effects models with spatial and spatiotemporal random fields.” bioRxiv, 2022–03.\n\n\nThorson, James T. 2019. “Guidance for decisions using the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package in stock, ecosystem, habitat and climate assessments.” Fisheries Research 210: 143–61.\n\n\nTolimieri, Nick, John Wallace, and Melissa Haltuch. 2020. “Spatio-temporal patterns in juvenile habitat for 13 groundfishes in the California Current Ecosystem.” PloS One 15 (8): e0237996.",

    "text": "Description We estimated the relative availability of groundfish biomass to individual ports following the methods described in Selden et al. (2020), with some exceptions. In brief, we used data from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center’s West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (Keller et al. 2017) to estimate spatial distribution of species-specific biomass (Location Biomass), and the Center of Gravity (CoG) of the Location Biomass. We then calculate the Availability Index for each port by summing the Location Biomass within a radius from that port based on the 75th quantile of the distance traveled from port to harvest of species of interest, weighted by catch, as measured from trawl logbooks. We analyzed 12 species that make up a large component of landings for vessels using bottom trawl gear along the West Coast, or that have broader management interest (e.g., shortbelly rockfish).\nThe present analysis differs from Selden et al. (2020) in three ways:\n1- We estimated the spatial distribution of species using the R package sdmTMB (Anderson et al. 2022; R Core Team 2023) instead of VAST (Thorson 2019). The sdmTMB models included Pass and normalized depth as fixed parameters. Year was a time variable and models included both spatial and spatiotemporal (iid) autocorrelation, and a delta-poisson-link-gamma error distribution (Thorson 2018) error distribution.\n2- We used the Location Biomass directly instead of scaling it by spawning stock biomass from the assessment. Thus, the Availability Index is a relative biomass index and not actual available biomass. Biomass was then scaled to 0-1 for presentation by dividing by the highest value in any year.\n3- We used only the WCGBTS, and did not combine the Triennial survey (1980-2004) with the WCGBTS. This approach shortens the analysis period but allows us to expand the depth range to 55-1250 m.\n2025-01 Update\nPrevious sdmTMB models used a delta-poisson-link-gamma model structure/distribution and included depth a linear factor. In 2025 (for the CY2025 ESR), models were updated to use a delta-lognormal model structure, and normalized depth was included as a smoothed variable (with three knots). The delta-lognormal models produced better residuals (as evaluate with QQ-plots) than the delta-poisson-link-gamma models. The smoothed depth term allowed non-linear relationships with depth, such as higher mid-depth abundance versus shallow and deeper zones.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

Albacore, Bluefin, and Swordfish stomachs were provided by commercial and recreational fishers, and prey were identified from whole or hard part remains and are reported as a mean percent abundance. A subset of prey species are presented here focusing on prey that are either themselves under a management plan, or considered ecosystem component species, to highlight their links to highly migratory species. Juvenile Albacore Tuna were collected off Northern California, Oregon, and Washington during the summer and fall fishing season. Bluefin Tuna were collected by recreational fishers in the Southern California Bight from spring until early fall. Swordfish were collected off Southern and Central California during the commercial drift gillnet season (August 15th through January 31st). Swordfish stomachs are classified by the year the fishing season began (stomachs from January are assigned to the previous year’s fishing season).\n[need for descriptive text for figures?]\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

Pup count relates to prey availability and nutritional status for gestating females from October to June. Pup growth from birth to age 7 months is related to prey availability to lactating females from June to February. Data on the overwinter growth rate of sea lion pups were not available at the time of submission of this document. Nursing female diet information was also not available in time for this report but the lower number of births and moderate condition of pups for the 2023 cohort indicates that foraging conditions may have declined for nursing females in the past year.\nTo reduce disturbance to California sea lions and to improve the accuracy of our pup counts, we transitioned to using small drones (Aerial Imagery Systems’ APH-28 and the Parrot Anafi) for our pup census in 2023. A pilot study in 2017 and 2018 that paired drone surveys and ground counts for the same areas showed no significant differences in counts determined from drones or ground counts. The drone surveys were flown at an altitude of 46 m over small or narrow sections of coastline or in transects over large areas. The images were stitched together using DigiKam software and pups were counted using DotDotGoose software that automatically entered the counts into a data file for analysis. In 2023, weather conditions precluded using the drones for the entire count so we conducted ground counts for about 20% of the colony and used drones for 80%.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

    "text": "Description Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of diatoms in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia have been a recurring concern along the West Coast. Certain species of Pseudo-nitzschia produce the toxin domoic acid, which can accumulate in filter feeders and extend through food webs to cause harmful or lethal effects on people, marine mammals, and seabirds (Lefebvre et al. 2002; McCabe et al. 2016). Because domoic acid can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans, fisheries that target shellfish (including razor clam, Dungeness crab, rock crab, and spiny lobster) are delayed, closed, or operate under special orders or health advisories when domoic acid concentrations exceed regulatory thresholds for human consumption. Fishery closures can cost tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue, and cause a range of sociocultural impacts in fishing communities (Dyson and Huppert 2010; Ritzman et al. 2018; Holland and Leonard 2020; Moore et al. 2020), including a “spillover” of fishing effort into other fisheries.\nOcean conditions associated with marine heatwaves, El Niño events, or positive PDO regimes may further exacerbate domoic acid toxicity and fishery impacts, and domoic acid toxicity tracks anomalies of southern copepod biomass (Fig. 3.1) (McCabe et al. 2016; McKibben et al. 2017). The largest and most toxic HAB of Pseudo-nitzschia on the West Coast occurred in 2015, coincident with the 2013-2016 marine heatwave, and caused the longest-lasting and most widespread HAB-related fisheries closures on record (McCabe et al. 2016; Moore et al. 2019; Trainer et al. 2020). Closures and delays in the opening of West Coast crab fisheries resulted in the appropriation of &gt;$25M in federal disaster relief funds (McCabe et al. 2016).\nAccording to thresholds set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, domoic acid levels ≥20 parts per million (ppm) trigger actions for all seafood and tissues except Dungeness crab viscera, for which the level is &gt;30 ppm (California applies this to rock crab viscera as well) (FDA 2011). Under evisceration orders, Dungeness crab can be landed when the viscera exceeds the threshold but the meat does not, provided that crab are eviscerated by a licensed processor. Oregon was the first West Coast state to pass legislation allowing evisceration, in November 2017, followed by California in October 2021. Washington adopted an emergency evisceration rule in February 2021, and is considering legislation to grant long-term authority for issuing evisceration orders.\n[add more from past ESRs]\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

Six broad-scale indicators of long-term, spatial variation in oceanography and lower-trophic level productivity are being used to inform spatial suitability analyses in areas off northern California being considered for OWE development in 2024. The ecosystem indicators include: 1. Average wind-driven upwelling during March-July, calculated at 40m depth from 1988-2012 using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (Raghukumar et al. 2023); 2. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots in primary productivity, calculated from a biogeochemistry model as the average concentration of surface phytoplankton in May-July, 1995-2020 (Fiechter et al. 2018); 3. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots in secondary productivity from May-August, calculated as an ensemble of four different estimates of krill abundance/biomass across the West Coast (Cimino et al. 2020; Fiechter et al. 2020; Messié et al. 2022; Phillips et al. 2022); 4. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots for young-of-year (YOY) rockfishes during their pelagic juvenile life stage in May-June from 2001-2022 (Field et al. 2021); 5.Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots for YOY Pacific hake in May-June from 2001-2022 (Field et al. 2021); 6. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots of groundfish nursery habitat on the seafloor, based on summed average densities of juveniles from 13 groundfish species in May-October from 2003-2018 (Tolimieri et al. 2020).\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has been using a spatial suitability analysis developed by NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal and Ocean Science (NCCOS) to identify areas BOEM may consider for OWE development. In order to inform an analysis of new areas along the northern California coast, we used BOEM’s methods to calculate an overall suitability score across the six ecosystem indicators for each grid cell (Riley et al. 2021). Briefly, the raw data for each indicator was cropped to the area-of-interest, interpolated across a 2x2-km spatial grid, transformed using a z-membership function, and then geometrically averaged across all indicators for each grid cell. This geometric mean represents the suitability score of a grid cell for OWE development relative to the importance of these areas to the processes represented by each indicator; thus, a suitability score of ‘1’ is most suitable for OWE, while suitability scores closer to 0 are less suitable. In addition to being applicable to siting of new areas, these indicators could be used to establish baseline conditions that can be used to identify potential effects resulting from OWE development and to identify relevant mitigation strategies.\nFisheries Indicators. We developed seven indicators that describe spatial and temporal variation in groundfish bottom trawling activity from 2002-2021 in the same region being considered for OWE development off the coast of northern California. These indicators were presented in the 2022 ESR and are meant to capture the spatial and temporal variation in fishing effort for the groundfish bottom trawl fishery and to be used in tandem with the ecosystem indicators to identify potential interactions across the entire social-ecological system.\nFor the groundfish indicators herein, we used logbook set and retrieval coordinates from the limited-entry/catch shares groundfish bottom trawl fisheries to estimate total duration trawled on a 2x2-km grid. These durations were then used to calculate: 1. total duration trawled in the most recent year (2021); 2. the anomaly of the most recent year relative to the entire time series; 3. the most recent 5-year mean (2017-2021); 4. the most recent 5-year trend (2017-2021); 5. the sum of duration trawled across all years; 6. the proportion of years trawled; and 7. the number of years since trawling occurred within each grid cell.\nTo maintain confidentiality, grid cells with &lt;3 vessels operating within the grid cell across the years associated with the indicator have been removed. The first four indicators are consistent with measuring the ‘status’ and ‘trends’ of other ecosystem indicators presented in this report, while the last three have been developed as indicators to use within a risk analysis framework. These indicators account for only federal limited-entry/catch shares groundfish bottom trawl fisheries from 2002-2021, but provide a useful framework for identifying the potential for overlap and conflict between day-to-day fisheries operations and OWE areas. Other fisheries were included in a similar framework and will be added as analyses are completed.",

    "text": "Description The Community Social Vulnerability Index (CSVI) is an indicator of social vulnerability in coastal communities that are dependent upon commercial fishing. To gain further insight into community vulnerability in relation to commercial fishing, fishing dependence, which can be expressed in terms of engagement, reliance, or by a composite of both, can be considered in relation to CSVI. Engagement refers to the total extent of fishing activity in a community; it can be expressed in terms of commercial activity (e.g., landings, revenues, permits, processing, etc). Reliance is the per capita engagement of a community; thus, in two communities with equal engagement, the community with the smaller population would have a higher reliance on its fisheries activities.\nSimilar to the commercial fishing reliance and engagement measures produced as a part of the Community Social Vulnerability Index (CSVI), we have developed index measures for recreational fishing engagement and reliance, absent in prior versions of this report as consistent annual data had not been identified. As with the commercial fishing Index construction, following the method proposed by Jepson and Colburn (2013), data directly linking place-based communities to the economic aspects of recreational fishing, which could be attributed to specific calendar years, were compiled from six distinct sources as inputs for the measures. Charter and guide permit data collected by state managers were obtained and linked to Census-Designated Place (CDP) based communities. Additionally, historic fishing tackle business location data was compiled from Data Axel, the provider of business location data to Environmental Systems Research Institute’s (ESRI) business analyst application. Marina business location data was also obtained from ESRI and ESRI’s provider. These data enable interannual comparisons and allow for future replicable iterations.\nCommunities that score highly in either commercial or recreational reliance in addition to higher social vulnerability scores may be especially socially vulnerable to downturns in fishing. Fishing reliance can be volatile: communities can move left on the x-axis in years with reduced landings, and may thus appear to be less dependent on commercial fishing when in fact they have actually just experienced a difficult year; therefore, these results should be interpreted with care. These same qualifications apply to recreational fishing reliance measures, and several communities are among the most reliant in their respective regions for both commercial and recreational fishing. These data are difficult to groundtruth and interpreting trends requires further study.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

    "text": "Description Catches and prices from many fisheries exhibit high interannual variability, leading to high variability in fisher’s revenue, but variability can be reduced by diversifying activities across multiple fisheries or regions (Kasperski and Holland 2013). Individuals may have good reasons to specialize, including reduced costs or greater efficiency; thus while diversification may reduce income variation, it does not necessarily promote higher average profitability. We use the Effective Shannon Index (ESI) to examine diversification of fishing revenue for more than 28,000 vessels fishing off the West Coast and Alaska over the last 40 years. The ESI increases as revenues are spread across more fisheries, and as revenues are spread more evenly across fisheries; ESI = 1 when a vessel’s revenues are from a single species group and region; ESI = 2 if revenues are spread evenly across 2 fisheries; ESI = 3 if revenues are spread evenly across 3 fisheries; and so on. If revenue is not evenly distributed across fisheries, then the ESI value is lower than the number of fisheries a vessel enters.\nDiversification can take other forms. Spreading effort and catch over the year, or simply fishing more weeks of the year, can both increase revenue and decrease interannual variation of revenue just as species diversification does. In fact, Abbot et al. (2023) showed that reductions in revenue variation associated with species diversification can be explained mainly by increased temporal diversification, which can be achieved by fishing in multiple fisheries but also by fishing for more weeks of the year in a single fishery. Effective Shannon Index can also be used to examine how widely and evenly vessel revenues are spread across weeks of the year as an indicator or temporal diversification. Like the species diversification metric, this index increases the more weeks of the year a vessel has revenue and the more evenly that revenue is distributed across weeks. A vessel fishing 15 weeks of the year with the same revenue each of those weeks would have a temporal ESI of 15, and that number would decline as revenue is spread less evenly over the 15 weeks.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",

    "text": "Description Compared to many other professions, fishers face unusually high year-to-year variability in their income levels. Diversifying fishing income can help reduce income variability and reduce financial risk, but focusing solely on diversification opportunities within the fishery misses a potentially important form of financial risk reduction - income diversification from non-fishing occupations (i.e., livelihood diversification). Livelihood diversification may actually be a more effective form of financial risk reduction for fishing households if their non-fishing income streams are unaffected by changes in fishery productivity or profitability or if they can be actively increased when fishing income is low.\nLevels and trends in non-fishery income diversification have not been presented previously due to a lack of regularly collected data on non-fishery income (NFI). To address this and other informational gaps, the NWFSC began periodically surveying West Coast fishing vessel owners on a triennial basis with surveys carried out in 2017, 2020, and 2023. Surveys were sent to all vessel owners with commercial revenue from West Coast fisheries (federal and state) the prior year. Response rates were around 50% in 2017 and 2020 with over 1400 surveys returned each year. The response rate in 2023 fell to 40% with 1163 surveys returned.\nAmong other questions, the surveys ask fishing vessel owners what percentage of their household income came from fishing versus non-fishing sources in the prior calendar year (e.g. 2022 for the 2023 survey) and also what percentage of the income they personally contribute to the household is from non-fishery sources. The survey also asks vessel owners that personally contributed NFI to their household what type of non-fishing work they did. Treakle et al. (2023) provides a detailed analysis of the survey data on non-fishing income from the 2017 and 2020 surveys.\nData sources\nData extraction\nData analysis",
