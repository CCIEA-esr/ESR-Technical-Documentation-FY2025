# Northern California Current Forage

**Description** The Northern CCE survey (known as the Juvenile Salmon Ocean Ecology Survey, JSOES) occurs in June and targets juvenile salmon in surface waters off Oregon and Washington. It also collects adult and juvenile (age 1+) pelagic forage fishes, market squid, and gelatinous zooplankton with regularity. A Nordic 264 rope trawl is towed for 15-30 min at approximately 6.5 km/hr. The gear is fished during daylight hours in near-surface (upper 20 m) waters, which is appropriate for targeting juvenile salmon.

Several other taxa collected by the June JSOES surface trawl are noted in terms of their relative prevalence (proportion of stations where they were caught), but are not considered to be sampled quantitatively due to their behavior and mesh size of sampling gear.

Pelagic forage data from the Northern CCE are provided by B. Burke, NMFS/NWFSC and C. Morgan, OSU/CIMRS. Data are derived from surface trawls taken during the NWFSC Juvenile Salmon & Ocean Ecosystem Survey (JSOES; https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/ocean-ecosystem-indicators-pacific-salmon-marine-survival-northern). Similarity analysis and cluster plot by A. Thompson, NMFS/SWFSC.
