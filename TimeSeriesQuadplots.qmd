**Methods** 
The Ecosystem Status Report uses as standard time-series and quadplot format for many data streams ([Fig. @fig-standard-plots]).

```{r}
#| label: fig-standard-plots
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "a) Sample time-series plot, with indicator data relative to the long-term mean (black dashed horizontal line) and ±1.0 standard deviation (SD; solid blue lines) of the full time series. Dotted black line indicates missing data, and points (when included) indicate data. Arrow at the right indicates if the trend over the evaluation period (shaded blue) is positive (↗), negative (↘), or neutral (↔). Symbol at the lower right indicates if the recent mean was greater than (+), less than (-), or within 1.0 SD of the long-term mean. When possible, times series indicate observation error (gray envelope), defined for each plot (e.g., SD, standard error, or 95% confidence intervals). b) Sample time-series plot with the indicator plotted relative to a threshold value (blue line). Dashed lines indicate upper and lower observation error, again defined for each plot. Dotted black line indicates missing data. c) Sample quad plot where each point represents one normalized time series. The position of a point indicates if the recent trend was increasing or decreasing over the evaluation period and whether the recent mean over the evaluation period"
