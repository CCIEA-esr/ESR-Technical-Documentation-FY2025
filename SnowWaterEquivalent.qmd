# Snow-water equivalent

**Description** Snow-water equivalent (SWE) is measured using data from the California Department of Water Resources snow survey program (California Data Exchange Center, cdec.water.ca.gov) and The Natural Resources Conservation Serviceâ€™s SNOTEL sites across Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho. Snow data are converted into SWEs based on the weight of samples collected at regular intervals using a standardized protocol. Measurements on April 1 are considered the best indicator of maximum extent of SWE; thereafter snow tends to melt rather than accumulate.
