# Fishery Landings
{{< include _setup.qmd >}}

**Description** Fishery landings are indicators of ecosystem services provided and also reflect removals from the CCE. Commercial landings data are best summarized by the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN; pacfin.psmfc.org), and recreational landings are best summarized by the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN; www.recfin.org). Landings provide the best long-term indicator of fisheries removals. Status and trends are estimated relative to a frame of reference of 1991-2020. In most cases, landings data for the most recent reporting years are only complete through the latter months (e.g., October-December); these data are updated in the next annual cycle.

Commercial landings data are reported coastwide and by state (CA, OR, WA) by fishery species category; in the case of recreational landings, however, we use the same geographic reporting distinctions but differentiate only between salmon recreational and total recreational landings.
