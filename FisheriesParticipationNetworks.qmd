# Fisheries Participation Networks

**Description** Fisheries participation networks (FPNs) represent how diversified harvest portfolios create connections between fisheries (Fuller et al 2017, Fisher et al 2021). FPNs have shown how West Coast networks change over time, how groundfish fisheries are connected to other fisheries in different IO-PAC port groups (Harvey et al. 2022), and the vulnerability of West Coast port groups to future shocks to salmon fishing, based on economic dependence (a measure of sensitivity) and a resilience index based on fisheries connectivity (a measure of adaptive capacity) (Harvey et al. 2023). More recently, we compare the number of active salmon vessels and the revenue of commercial salmon vessels between two periods (2017-2022 and 2022-2023) for West Coast port groups.
