# Data and Code Access

**About the CCIEA Ecosystem Status Report (ESR)** The annual CCIEA Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) is a Quarto document; hosted on the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) Github page, and developed in R.

**Indicator data** Derived data sets make up the majority of the indicators presented in the CCIEA ESR. In this technical documentation, we list the derived indicators, their source, and where possible, the computations used to produce them from the raw data. This metadata is also [publicly available](https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/CCIEA_metadata.html) for download. The derived indicator data can be downloaded using links in the sections of this document unless there are privacy concerns involved. In that case, it may be possible to access source data by reaching out to the Data Steward associated with that data set.

**Data flow** Indicator data is submitted by data providers in a standard format consisting of "long" csv files with standardized column headers and consistent file names. These requirements allow all indicators to be handled with the same R plotting code and enable automation of the data upload process.

After uploading, standardized data and metadata is organized on a private Google Drive by ESR year, and served publicly via [ERDDAPâ„¢](https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/search/index.html?&searchFor=cciea_)
