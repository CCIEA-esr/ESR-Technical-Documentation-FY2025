The assessment assumes that there is one stock of bigeye in the eastern Pacific. The reference models for the 2024 benchmark assessment of bigeye were built based on three overarching hypotheses. The regime shift in recruitment evident in the last assessment has largely disappeared, resulting from improvements to the assessment model. The bimodality in model results from the last assessment has also been resolved. Overall results of a risk analysis, based on thirty-three converged reference models, show a 46.6% probability that the spawning biomass at the beginning of 2024 is below the target reference point, and a 24.7% probability that the fishing mortality in 2021-2023 is above the target reference point.

Skipjack tuna are assumed to comprise one contiguous stock throughout the Pacific ocean. In the eastern Pacific, they are primarily fished in tropical waters, using purse seine gear. Skipjack have historically been difficult to assess with standard stock assessment methods, due to high and variable productivity, and uncertainties in natural mortality and growth. The 2024 assessment used an integrated statistical age-structured catch-at-length model in Stock Synthesis. A conservative proxy for the target biomass of spawning biomass ratio (SBR) = 0.3, and the fishing mortality corresponding to that biomass, were used as the target reference points. The reference model estimated that the current fishing mortality is below the level corresponding to the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) proxy and the spawning biomass is above the dynamic level corresponding to the MSY proxy. In addition, the spawning biomass does not have a 10% or more probability of exceeding the limit. The stock assessment is completed through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC).

All models were used to produce management advice by combining them using relative weights determined based on several criteria, including performance on model diagnostics. The multimodel inference was based on the weighted average of the estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were computed using a normal approximation for each model, combined in a mixture of normal distributions with the mixing ratios equal to the model weights and finding the values for each year where the cumulative distribution function was equal to 0.025 and 0.975 for the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval. The spawning stock biomass index represents total fecundity. A key uncertainty not addressed in this assessment is the spatial structure of the stock of yellowfin tuna in the EPO.

The latest (2023) stock assessment report was completed through the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC). North Pacific albacore are considered to be one stock throughout the North Pacific Ocean. They are fished throughout their range by multiple countries, mostly using surface gear (troll and pole and line), as well as pelagic longlines and other gears. Their population dynamics are assessed using an age-, length- and sex-structured model (Stock Synthesis v3). The assessment model used was similar to that in the 2017 benchmark assessment, with four important changes: 1) adjusting coefficients of variation for the abundance index in 2020-21 to better reflect uncertainty surrounding disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) adjustments to Japan longline fleet structure, 3) adjustments to adult abundance indices, and 4) adjustments to age selectivity. The full assessment is available from http://isc.fra.go.jp/reports/stock_assessments.html.

The assessment assumes that there is one stock of bigeye in the eastern Pacific. The reference models for the 2024 benchmark assessment of bigeye were built based on three overarching hypotheses. The regime shift in recruitment evident in the last assessment has largely disappeared, resulting from improvements to the assessment model. The bimodality in model results from the last assessment has also been resolved. Overall results of a risk analysis, based on thirty-three converged reference models, show a 46.6% probability that the spawning biomass at the beginning of 2024 is below the target reference point, and a 24.7% probability that the fishing mortality in 2021-2023 is above the target reference point.

Skipjack tuna are assumed to comprise one contiguous stock throughout the Pacific ocean. In the eastern Pacific, they are primarily fished in tropical waters, using purse seine gear. Skipjack have historically been difficult to assess with standard stock assessment methods, due to high and variable productivity, and uncertainties in natural mortality and growth. The 2024 assessment used an integrated statistical age-structured catch-at-length model in Stock Synthesis. A conservative proxy for the target biomass of spawning biomass ratio (SBR) = 0.3, and the fishing mortality corresponding to that biomass, were used as the target reference points. The reference model estimated that the current fishing mortality is below the level corresponding to the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) proxy and the spawning biomass is above the dynamic level corresponding to the MSY proxy. In addition, the spawning biomass does not have a 10% or more probability of exceeding the limit. The stock assessment is completed through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC).

All models were used to produce management advice by combining them using relative weights determined based on several criteria, including performance on model diagnostics. The multimodel inference was based on the weighted average of the estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were computed using a normal approximation for each model, combined in a mixture of normal distributions with the mixing ratios equal to the model weights and finding the values for each year where the cumulative distribution function was equal to 0.025 and 0.975 for the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval. The spawning stock biomass index represents total fecundity. A key uncertainty not addressed in this assessment is the spatial structure of the stock of yellowfin tuna in the EPO. Future work to further improve the assessment will focus on this. This information was provided by Carolina Minte-Vera and Haikun Xu (IATTC) via IATTC-95-05.

MHWs are a growing field of study worldwide because of their effects on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and regional economies. Developed by oceanographers from NOAA Fisheries' Southwest Fisheries Science Center as an experimental tool for natural resource managers, the California Current MHW Tracker is a program designed to understand, describe, and provide a historical context for the 2014-16 blob. It also produces a range of indices that could help forecast or predict future MHWs expected to impact our coast.",,MHW_data_table.csv,oc_mhw_D.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
