# Sea Surface Temperature (SST)

Satellite data, which has been collected in a similar fashion since 1982, allows for a basin-scale view of sea surface temperature (SST) at up to daily and sub-degree (spatial) resolution.

Glider data has also become an increasingly useful tool for analyzing trends in subsurface water temperatures over time. Subsurface gliders, which generally sample in onshore-offshore transects on a weekly to monthly basis, have been in service long enough for the development of climatologies, which are then used to compute temperature anomalies.
